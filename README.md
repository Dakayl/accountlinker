# Account Linker
PHP BB 3.1.x Account Linker

Created by Dakayl (french LARPer) for RPG community. Have fun guys.

You are free to edit, change and improve this little mod.
Please see the licence (GNU GPL 3.0).

## Current Goals
- Account linking from Admin, Moderator or User (based upon admin choice of how to link)
- Easy account switching through a list of links (<li><a>) or selectbox (<select><option>).
- Compatible with datas from Accounts Links 0.7.9 for 3.0.x (might be easy to switch to another form of account linking)
- EN and FR translation.
- Accents and quote improved compatibility.

No "post as XXX" yet but my goal is to provide a solution that people can update to add this functionnality after if required.
